# Research-Methodology – Vi-Sign

This repository presents a **complete set of research methodology materials** for a **hypothetical master’s thesis proposal** developed as part of the *CS2205 – Research Methodology* course.

## 📘 Project Overview

**VI-SIGN** is a proposed system for translating **Vietnamese speech or text into continuous Vietnamese Sign Language (VSL) motions**.  
The project explores a **gloss-free approach** that integrates **prosody-aware control signals assisted by a Large Language Model (LLM)** to generate smooth, expressive, and temporally consistent sign language movements.

Key ideas include:
- Speech/Text → Continuous VSL motion generation  
- No gloss supervision  
- Prosody- and expression-aware control using LLMs  
- Construction of a Speech–Text–Sign dataset (~6,000 sentences)

> ⚠️ All materials in this repository are **hypothetical/sample academic content** and **do not represent an official or approved master’s thesis**.
